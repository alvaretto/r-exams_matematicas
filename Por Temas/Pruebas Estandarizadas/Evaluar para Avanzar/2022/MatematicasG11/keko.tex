\begin{question}
An industry-leading company seeks a qualified candidate for a management position.
A management consultancy carries out an assessment center which concludes in making
a positive or negative recommendation for each candidate: From previous assessments they know that
of those candidates that are actually eligible for the position (event $E$) $73\%$
get a positive recommendation (event $R$). However, out of those candidates that are not eligible
$79\%$ get a negative recommendation. Overall, they know that only
$9\%$ of all job applicants are actually eligible.

What is the corresponding fourfold table of the joint probabilities? (Specify all entries in percent.)
