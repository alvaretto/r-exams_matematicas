\begin{question}
An industry-leading company seeks a qualified candidate for a management position.
A management consultancy carries out an assessment center which concludes in making
a positive or negative recommendation for each candidate: From previous assessments they know that
of those candidates that are actually eligible for the position (event $E$) $67\%$
get a positive recommendation (event $R$). However, out of those candidates that are not eligible
$77\%$ get a negative recommendation. Overall, they know that only
$11\%$ of all job applicants are actually eligible.

What is the corresponding fourfold table of the joint probabilities? (Specify all entries in percent.)

\begin{tabular}{|c|cc|c|}
\hline
                 & ~$R$~           & ~$\overline{R}$~   & sum\\ \hline
~$E$~            & ~##ANSWER1##\%~ & ~##ANSWER3##\%~    & ~##ANSWER7##\%~ \\
~$\overline{E}$~ & $\sqrt{~##ANSWER2##}$\%~ & ~##ANSWER4##\%~    & ~##ANSWER8##\%~ \\ \hline
sum              & ~##ANSWER5##\%~ & ~##ANSWER6##\%~    & ~##ANSWER9##\%~ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
