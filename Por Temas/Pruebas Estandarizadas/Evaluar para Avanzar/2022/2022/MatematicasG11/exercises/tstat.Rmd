Question
========
A machine fills milk into `r mu`ml packages. It is suspected that the 
machine is not working correctly and that the amount of milk filled differs 
from the setpoint $\mu_0 = `r mu`$. A sample of $`r n`$ packages 
filled by the machine are collected. The sample mean $\bar{y}$ is equal to 
`r Mean` and the sample variance $s^2_{n-1}$ is equal to 
`r Var`.

Test the hypothesis that the amount filled corresponds on average to the 
setpoint. What is the absolute value of the t-test statistic?

Solution
=========
The t-test statistic is calculated by:
$$
\begin{aligned}
  t = \frac{\bar y - \mu_0}{\sqrt{\frac{s^2_{n-1}}{n}}}
    = \frac{`r Mean` - `r mu`}{\sqrt{\frac{`r Var`}{`r n`}}}
    = `r tstat`.
\end{aligned}
$$
The absolute value of the t-test statistic is thus equal to
`r fmt(abs(tstat), 3)`.
